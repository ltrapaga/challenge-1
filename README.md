# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

- My motivation when completing this project was to put into practice and become more proficient in the concepts I learned throughout Module 1: HTML, CSS, and Git of Bootcamp.
- I built this project to practice applying what I have learned in class about HTML, CSS, and Git to improve existing HTML and CSS code through refactoring.
- My refactoring of the HTML and CSS code improved the code's semantic structure. By improving the semantic structure, I was able to increase browser's and assitive technologies' ability to recognize the code, therefore increasing accessibility. 
- During the completion of this project, I learned how to properly replace non-semantic code with semantic code without changing the functionality of the web application. I also learned how to effectively consolidate selectors in my CSS code.
